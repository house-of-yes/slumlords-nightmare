## Let Them Scream

We’ve all seen it — rents spiking, people forced out, homes flipped like poker chips.  
**Slumlord’s Nightmare ($SCREAM)** is what happens when outrage gets tokenized.  
It’s a memecoin you can laugh with, fight with, and wear like a badge:  
a reminder that when they push us out, we don’t go quietly.
