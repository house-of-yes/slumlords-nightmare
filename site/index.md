# Slumlord’s Nightmare

## Let Them Scream

This project was born from lived experience:  
the dispossession of a long-term tenant, the destruction of personal property, and the callous greed of Sausalito landlords.

**Slumlord’s Nightmare ($SCREAM)** is a memecoin, but it’s also more than that:  
- A symbol of resistance against predatory housing practices.  
- A piece of living art, where the packet of evidence *is the brand*.  
- A mirror held up to those who profit from the suffering of others.

## The Lawsuit

The underlying case documents a pattern of harassment, neglect, and calculated eviction:
- A long-term tenant targeted simply for paying below-market rent.  
- In excess of two dozen ignored complaints about health and safety issues (rats, broken appliances, unsafe access).  
- The cruel disposal of staged property, including irreplaceable family heirlooms.  
- Procedural gamesmanship in the courts to ensure the tenant could not be heard.  

These pages tell the story in redacted form — enough to show the **truth** without revealing what must remain confidential.

## The Coin

Ticker: **$SCREAM**  
Tagline: **“Let Them.”**

Unlike most memecoins, this one is built on a foundation of lived injustice and creative revenge.  
Where others make promises they can’t keep, **Slumlord’s Nightmare** comes with a packet thick enough to give any lawyer palpitations.

## Dedication

This coin is dedicated to **Jenny** and **Maria** — the property manager and owner who made people homeless to fatten their books.  
It’s also dedicated to every tenant who has ever been pushed out, silenced, or shamed.  

**We are the nightmare that comes when you treat people as disposable.**
